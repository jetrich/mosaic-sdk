## 🔄 In Progress

### Waiting for Tony 2.7.0
- [ ] Tony submodule cannot be added until 2.7.0 work completes
- [ ] Another agent is actively working on 2.7.0 remediation
- [ ] MCP enforcement in Tony 2.8.0 is blocked

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (When Tony 2.7.0 Completes)
1. Add tony submodule to mosaic-sdk
2. Implement MCP mandatory requirement in Tony 2.8.0
3. Complete package namespace migrations

### Repository Operations (When Ready)
1. Rename GitHub repositories:
   - jetrich/tony-sdk → jetrich/mosaic-sdk
   - jetrich/tony-mcp → jetrich/mosaic-mcp (already using @mosaic/mcp internally)
2. Update all CI/CD pipelines
3. Configure GitHub redirects

### Testing & Release
1. Run integration tests across all components
2. Validate migration tools with real projects
3. Prepare release announcements
4. Launch beta testing program
