# Blocking Issues Requiring Human Intervention

**Generated**: January 2025  
**Agent**: Agent 12 - Final Integration Agent  
**Status**: Documentation of issues that require human action before full deployment

## üö´ Critical Blockers

### 1. MosAIc Stack Services Not Running
**Issue**: The MosAIc stack services (Gitea, PostgreSQL, Redis, BookStack, Woodpecker) are not currently deployed.

**Impact**: Cannot test full integration, CI/CD pipelines, or service communication.

**Required Actions**:
1. Navigate to deployment directory: `cd deployment/docker`
2. Ensure environment variables are configured in `.env`
3. Start services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mosaicstack-portainer.yml up -d`
4. Verify all services start successfully
5. Complete initial setup for each service

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

---

### 2. SSL Certificates Not Configured
**Issue**: No SSL certificates are currently configured for the services.

**Impact**: Services are only accessible via HTTP, creating security vulnerabilities.

**Required Actions**:
1. Obtain SSL certificates for your domain
2. Configure nginx-proxy-manager or Traefik for SSL termination
3. Update service configurations to use HTTPS
4. Test SSL configuration with SSL Labs

**Alternative**: Use Let's Encrypt for automatic SSL with Traefik

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### 3. Domain Names Not Set
**Issue**: Services are configured with placeholder domain names.

**Impact**: External access and OAuth integrations will not work properly.

**Required Actions**:
1. Register domain name if not already done
2. Configure DNS records for subdomains:
   - git.yourdomain.com
   - docs.yourdomain.com
   - ci.yourdomain.com
3. Update `.env` file with actual domain names
4. Restart services to apply changes

**Estimated Time**: 1-4 hours (depending on DNS propagation)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Configuration Issues

### 4. Database Passwords Using Defaults
**Issue**: Environment files contain placeholder passwords.

**Security Risk**: HIGH

**Required Actions**:
1. Generate strong passwords (minimum 16 characters)
2. Update all password fields in `.env`:
   - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
   - REDIS_PASSWORD
   - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD
   - GITEA_ADMIN_PASSWORD
3. Store passwords securely in password manager
4. Never commit actual passwords to Git

**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

---

### 5. Git Repositories Not Pushed to Gitea
**Issue**: All repositories exist locally but haven't been pushed to Gitea.

**Impact**: CI/CD pipelines cannot be tested, team collaboration blocked.

**Required Actions**:
1. Create organizations/users in Gitea
2. Create repositories in Gitea UI
3. Add Gitea as remote for each repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add gitea git@git.yourdomain.com:org/repo.git
   ```
4. Push all branches and tags:
   ```bash
   git push gitea --all
   git push gitea --tags
   ```

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

---

### 6. Woodpecker Agents Not Configured
**Issue**: Woodpecker server is configured but no agents are running.

**Impact**: CI/CD pipelines will queue but not execute.

**Required Actions**:
1. Generate agent secret in Woodpecker UI
2. Configure Woodpecker agent with secret
3. Start agent container(s)
4. Verify agent connects to server
5. Test with simple pipeline

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

## üîß Technical Debt Items

### 7. MCP Server HTTP Mode Not Implemented
**Issue**: MCP server only supports stdio mode, not HTTP as originally planned.

**Impact**: Limited to local development, cannot be used in distributed setup.

**Required Actions**:
1. Evaluate if HTTP mode is needed for production
2. If needed, implement HTTP server wrapper
3. Update client libraries to support HTTP
4. Add authentication/authorization

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 days development work

---

### 8. Test Project Dependencies Outdated
**Issue**: CI/CD test projects have outdated dependencies with security warnings.

**Impact**: Example projects may have vulnerabilities, bad practice for templates.

**Required Actions**:
1. Update all dependencies in test projects:
   ```bash
   cd tests/ci-cd-validation/node-ts && npm update
   cd ../react-next && npm update
   cd ../python && pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run security audits and fix issues
3. Update pipeline templates if needed

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### 9. Monitoring Stack Not Deployed
**Issue**: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting are configured but not deployed.

**Impact**: No visibility into system health, performance, or issues.

**Required Actions**:
1. Deploy monitoring stack: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d`
2. Configure Prometheus scrape targets
3. Import Grafana dashboards
4. Set up alert rules
5. Configure notification channels

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### 10. Backup Automation Not Enabled
**Issue**: Backup scripts exist but cron jobs are not configured.

**Impact**: Risk of data loss without automated backups.

**Required Actions**:
1. Test backup scripts manually
2. Configure cron jobs for automated backups
3. Set up offsite backup destination (S3, etc.)
4. Test restore procedures
5. Document recovery procedures

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

## üìù Documentation Gaps

### 11. User Onboarding Documentation Missing
**Issue**: No end-user documentation for using the MosAIc stack.

**Impact**: Team adoption will be slow, increased support burden.

**Required Actions**:
1. Create user guides for:
   - Gitea usage
   - BookStack documentation
   - CI/CD pipeline creation
   - Tony Framework usage
2. Record video tutorials
3. Create quick reference cards

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### 12. Disaster Recovery Plan Not Documented
**Issue**: No formal disaster recovery plan exists.

**Impact**: Extended downtime in case of major failure.

**Required Actions**:
1. Document recovery procedures
2. Define RPO/RTO objectives
3. Create runbooks for common failures
4. Test recovery procedures
5. Train team on procedures

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

## ü§ù Required Human Decisions

Before proceeding with deployment, the following decisions need to be made:

1. **Infrastructure Provider**: Where will this be hosted? (AWS, GCP, on-premise, etc.)
2. **Domain Strategy**: What domain/subdomains will be used?
3. **User Management**: How will users be authenticated? (Local, LDAP, OAuth?)
4. **Backup Strategy**: Where will backups be stored? How long retained?
5. **Monitoring Alerts**: Who should receive alerts? What severity levels?
6. **Security Policies**: What security policies need to be enforced?
7. **Scaling Strategy**: Expected load and scaling requirements?

**Note**: This document should be reviewed with all stakeholders before proceeding with production deployment. Each blocking issue should be assigned an owner and target completion date.
