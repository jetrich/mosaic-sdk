## ðŸ”„ Current Status

### Active Work
- Waiting for Tony 2.7.0 completion before proceeding with:
  - Adding tony submodule to mosaic-sdk
  - Implementing MCP mandatory requirement
  - Updating Tony to 2.8.0

### @mosaic/core Implementation (NEW - 2025-07-18)
- [x] Created git worktree: `feature/core-orchestration`
- [x] Implemented core orchestration engine components:
  - [x] MosaicCore - Central orchestration engine
  - [x] ProjectManager - Hierarchical task management
  - [x] AgentCoordinator - Multi-agent coordination
  - [x] WorkflowEngine - Complex workflow execution
  - [x] EventBus - Event-driven architecture
  - [x] StateManager - Pluggable state management
- [x] Set up TypeScript build tooling
- [x] Successfully built and tested compilation
- [x] Pushed to GitHub branch: `feature/core-orchestration`
- [x] Pending: Integration with mosaic-mcp for actual MCP connectivity âœ…

### MCP Integration Success (NEW - 2025-07-18)
- [x] Implemented full MCP client in MCPClient.ts:
  - [x] Stdio transport using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
  - [x] Server process spawning and management
  - [x] Tool listing and invocation
  - [x] Agent registration and messaging
- [x] Created integration test script (test-mcp-integration.ts)
- [x] Successfully tested connection to mosaic-mcp server:
  - Connected via stdio transport
  - Listed 14 available tools
  - Made tool calls (tony_project_list, tony_project_create)
  - Registered agents and sent inter-agent messages
  - Clean disconnect
- [x] @mosaic/core now fully integrated with MCP infrastructure

### Isolated Development Environment
- Created complete isolation system for testing MosAIc
- MCP server runs on port 3456 (separate from production)
- Can use `./mosaic tony` or `./mosaic claude` for isolated testing

### mosaic-mcp TypeScript Build Errors Fixed (NEW - 2025-07-18)
- [x] Fixed unused variable errors (TS6133) in test files
- [x] Fixed possible undefined object errors (TS2532)
- [x] Fixed index signature access errors (TS4111)
- [x] Removed unused imports (randomUUID, HookEvent, TaskType)
- [x] Added proper null checks with optional chaining
- [x] Updated parameter names to use underscore prefix for unused params
- [x] Build now completes successfully with validation passing
- [x] MCP server starts successfully: "âœ… Tony MCP Server ready"
- Other projects remain unaffected

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (When Tony 2.7.0 Completes)

1. **Add Tony Submodule**
   ```bash
   cd ~/src/mosaic-sdk
   git submodule add https://github.com/jetrich/tony.git tony
   ```

2. **Implement MCP Mandatory in Tony 2.8.0**
   - Remove all standalone/file-based fallbacks
   - Update configuration to require MCP
   - Update error messages for missing MCP

3. **Create @mosaic/core Package**
   - Basic orchestration engine
   - Multi-project coordination
   - Web dashboard foundation

4. **Complete Package Migrations**
   - Run migrate-packages.js on all components
   - Update all imports and dependencies
   - Verify with integration tests

5. **Release Coordination**
   - Tag all components with appropriate versions
   - Publish to npm registry
   - Update documentation

## ðŸš§ Blockers

1. **Tony 2.7.0 Work**: Another agent is actively working on remediation
   - Must not modify tony submodule until complete
   - This blocks MCP mandatory implementation

## ðŸ’¡ Notes for Continuation

### Session Context
- Working from ~/src/tony-sdk directory
- mosaic-sdk is at ~/src/mosaic-sdk
- All GitHub operations completed successfully
- Isolated environment ready for testing

### Key Commands
```bash
# Test isolated environment
cd ~/src/mosaic-sdk
./mosaic dev start
./mosaic test

# Check Tony 2.7.0 status
cd ~/src/tony && git status

# When ready to continue
cd ~/src/mosaic-sdk
./scripts/worktree-helper.sh create tony feature/mcp-mandatory mcp-mandatory
```

### Important URLs
- MosAIc SDK: https://github.com/jetrich/mosaic-sdk
- Renamed Repos:
  - https://github.com/jetrich/mosaic-mcp (was tony-mcp)
  - https://github.com/jetrich/mosaic-dev (was tony-dev)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

- [x] Repository structure created
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] GitHub operations complete
- [x] Isolated dev environment ready
- [ ] Tony 2.8.0 with mandatory MCP
- [ ] All packages migrated
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Beta release published
