## Command Aliases

For faster access to commonly used commands, Tony provides convenient aliases:

```bash
# Instead of 'tony qa'
qa --comprehensive

# Instead of 'tony plan'  
plan init --project "My Project"
plan phase1

# Tab completion works with aliases too
qa <TAB>                 # Shows qa command options
plan <TAB>               # Shows plan subcommands
```

## Tab Completion

Tony includes comprehensive bash tab completion for enhanced productivity:

### Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Install completion
tony --install-completion

# Restart shell or source manually
source ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/tony
```

### Usage
```bash
tony <TAB>               # Complete main commands
tony plan <TAB>          # Complete plan subcommands  
tony qa --<TAB>          # Complete qa options
tony help <TAB>          # Complete help topics
```

**Supported Completions:**
- All discovered Tony commands
- Subcommands (e.g., plan phases, qa options)
- Global options (--help, --version, --list)
- Context-aware completion for different commands

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Command Chaining
```bash
# Execute multiple planning phases
tony plan phase1 && tony plan phase2 && tony plan phase3

# QA with multiple analysis types
tony qa --code-quality && tony qa --test-coverage
```

### Integration with Other Tools
```bash
# Combine with git workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
tony plan init --project "New Feature"
tony qa --comprehensive

# CI/CD integration
tony cicd && tony qa --comprehensive && git push
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Typical development session
tony status              # Check system health
tony plan init           # Start planning
tony plan phase1         # Define epics
tony plan phase2         # Break down tasks
# ... development work ...
tony qa --comprehensive  # Quality check
tony upgrade             # Stay current
```

## Command Discovery

Tony automatically discovers commands by scanning for `tony-*.sh` scripts in:

- `/tony/scripts/` (local scripts - highest priority)
- `/tony-dev/bootstrap/conversion/scripts/` (distributed scripts)

**Adding New Commands:**
1. Create a new `tony-<command>.sh` script
2. Make it executable (`chmod +x`)
3. Place it in one of the discovery directories
4. It will automatically appear in `tony --list`

## Error Handling

### Unknown Commands
```bash
tony unknown-command
# Error: Unknown command 'unknown-command'
# Available commands: [lists all commands]
# Run 'tony --help' for more information.
```

### Command-Specific Help
```bash
# Get help for any command
tony <command> --help

# Examples
tony plan --help         # Planning system help
tony qa --help           # QA options and usage
tony status --help       # Status command help
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Verify installation
tony status              # Quick health check
tony verify              # Comprehensive verification

# Fix common issues
tony migrate             # Fix version compatibility
tony force-upgrade       # Force clean upgrade
```

## Version Information

```bash
# Check coordinator version
tony --version

# Check full system status
tony status
```

## Integration Notes

### Multi-Agent Development
- Commands work seamlessly across multiple agent sessions
- Worktree-based development prevents command conflicts
- Context preservation through agent handoffs
- Consistent interface across all agent-created commands

### Claude Integration
- Natural language activation with "Hey Tony"
- Automatic context switching and agent coordination
- Seamless integration with Claude workflows
- No manual configuration required

### Backwards Compatibility
- All existing `tony-*.sh` scripts work unchanged
- Legacy command invocations continue to function
- Gradual migration path for existing projects
- Zero breaking changes for existing workflows
