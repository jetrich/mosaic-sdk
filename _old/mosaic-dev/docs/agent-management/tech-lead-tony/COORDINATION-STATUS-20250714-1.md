- **Scalability**: Connection pooling and error handling support growth
- **Security**: Database file permissions and error handling secure
- **Performance**: Foundation supports target load requirements

## Milestone 0.0.1 Progress

### Completion Status
- **Completed Issues**: 2 of 15 total tasks (13.3%)
- **Critical Path Progress**: Foundation established for all subsequent work
- **Time Performance**: On schedule (5.5 hours of estimated 7-day timeline)

### Projected Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-3)**: ✅ Foundation Complete (ahead of schedule)
- **Phase 2 (Days 4-6)**: Build system and migrations (in progress)
- **Phase 3 (Days 7-10)**: Schema implementation (ready to start)
- **Phase 4 (Days 11-15)**: Performance and optimization

## Next Actions

### Immediate Deployment (Day 2)
1. **Deploy Build System Agent for Issue #5** - ready to start immediately
2. **Deploy Migration System Agent for Issue #7** - ready to start immediately
3. **Continue monitoring for parallel work opportunities**

### Phase 2 Coordination Strategy
- **Sequential Critical Path**: #5 → #14 → #11 (build and development tools)
- **Parallel Database Path**: #7 → #8 → #9 → #10 (migrations and schema)
- **Quality Assurance**: Deploy QA agent on Day 3 for validation
