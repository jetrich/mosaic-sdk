## Critical Path Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **#4** (Project Init) → **#5** (Build System) → **#14** (Dev Environment) → **#11** (Testing)
2. **#6** (SQLite Connection) → **#7** (Migrations) → **#8, #9, #10** (Schema Tables)
3. **#8, #9, #10** (All Tables) → **#12** (Indexing) → **#13** (Connection Pooling)

### Parallel Work Streams
- **TypeScript Foundation** (#4, #5) can run parallel to **SQLite Connection** (#6)
- **Testing Framework** (#11) can run parallel to **Database Infrastructure**
- **Health Check** (#15) can run parallel to **Schema Implementation**
- **Performance tasks** (#12, #13) can run partially in parallel

## Estimated Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
- Issues #4, #5, #6 (Project init, build system, SQLite connection)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Parallel execution possible**

### Phase 2: Development Infrastructure (Days 2-3)
- Issues #14, #11, #7 (Dev environment, testing, migrations)
- **Duration**: 1.5 days
- **Parallel execution possible**

### Phase 3: Schema Implementation (Days 3-5)
- Issues #8, #9, #10 (Projects, Agents, Activities tables)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Sequential execution required**

### Phase 4: Performance & Monitoring (Days 5-7)
- Issues #12, #13, #15 (Indexing, pooling, health checks)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Partial parallel execution**

### Total Estimated Duration: 7 development days

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items Identified
- **Issue #7**: Migration System (data integrity critical)
- **Issue #13**: Connection Pooling (concurrency complexity)
- **Issue #10**: Activities Table (high-volume performance)

### Medium Risk Items
- **Issue #6**: SQLite Connection Layer (error handling complexity)
- **Issue #12**: Database Indexing (performance optimization)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive testing for high-risk items
- Create backup/rollback procedures for migrations
- Performance test under realistic load conditions
- Implement monitoring for early issue detection

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All 12 issues completed and closed
- [ ] MCP server starts successfully
- [ ] Database schema creates without errors
- [ ] Performance targets achieved (<2s startup, <10ms queries)
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Health checks operational

### Quality Gates
- Each issue requires passing tests before closure
- Integration testing between components
- Performance validation under target load
- Code review and documentation completion

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Begin work on Issue #4 (Project Initialization)
2. **Day 1**: Start Issue #6 (SQLite Connection) in parallel
3. **Day 2**: Begin Issue #5 (Build System) after #4 completion
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor critical path and dependencies
