## Agent Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Path Foundation (Days 1-3)

#### Primary Agents
1. **Implementation Agent Alpha** 
   - **Assignment**: Issue #4 (Project Initialization & Configuration)
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL PATH START
   - **Dependencies**: None

   - **Context**: TypeScript project foundation, package.json, build system setup

2. **Database Agent Beta**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #6 (SQLite Connection Layer) 
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL PATH PARALLEL
   - **Dependencies**: None (can start with #4)
   - **Duration**: 3-4 hours
   - **Context**: SQLite integration, connection management, error handling

#### Agent Coordination Sequence
```
Day 1: Deploy Implementation Agent Alpha (#4) + Database Agent Beta (#6) in parallel
Day 2: Implementation Agent continues to #5 (Build System) after #4 completion
Day 3: Database Agent continues to #7 (Migrations) after #6 completion
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Expansion (Days 4-6)

#### Additional Agent Deployment
3. **Development Environment Agent**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #14 (Development Environment Setup)
   - **Dependencies**: Issue #5 completion (Build System)
   - **Context**: Nodemon, debugging, environment configuration

4. **Testing Framework Agent**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #11 (Testing Framework Integration)
   - **Dependencies**: Issue #5 completion (Build System)
   - **Context**: Jest setup, TypeScript testing, coverage reporting

### Phase 3: Database Schema Implementation (Days 7-10)

#### Schema Development Agents
5. **Schema Agent Alpha**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #8 (Projects Table Implementation)
   - **Dependencies**: Issue #7 completion (Migration System)
   - **Context**: Projects table, GUID management, CRUD operations

6. **Schema Agent Beta**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #9 (Agents Table Implementation)  
   - **Dependencies**: Issue #8 completion (Projects Table)
   - **Context**: Agents table, foreign keys, lifecycle management

7. **Schema Agent Gamma**
   - **Assignment**: Issue #10 (Activities Table Implementation)
   - **Dependencies**: Issue #9 completion (Agents Table)
   - **Context**: High-volume activity logging, performance optimization

## Agent Specialization & Context

### Implementation Agent Alpha
```
Specialization: TypeScript/Node.js project setup
Context Requirements:
- Modern TypeScript configuration (ES2020, strict mode)
- Package.json with proper scoping (@tony-framework/mcp)
- ESLint/Prettier configuration
- Directory structure following architecture plan
Success Criteria:
- npm run build compiles successfully
- Linting passes without errors
- Project structure supports MCP server development
```

### Database Agent Beta
```
Specialization: SQLite database architecture
Context Requirements:
- SQLite3 Node.js integration
- Connection pooling and lifecycle management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization for concurrent access
Success Criteria:
- Database connection established reliably
- Connection error handling prevents crashes
- Database initialization automated
- Foundation ready for schema implementation
```

### QA Validation Agent (Deploy on Day 3)
```
Specialization: Testing and validation
Context Requirements:
- Comprehensive test coverage validation
- Integration testing across components
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Code quality and security analysis
Success Criteria:
- >90% test coverage maintained
- All integration tests passing
- Performance targets validated
- Security vulnerabilities identified and resolved
```

## Coordination Protocols

### Agent Handoff Requirements
1. **Completion Verification**: Each agent must provide evidence of successful completion
2. **Context Transfer**: Detailed handoff documentation for dependent tasks
3. **Integration Testing**: Validation that components work together
4. **Documentation Update**: Progress tracking in milestone coordination

### Communication Standards
- **Status Updates**: Every 4 hours during active development
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediate escalation for dependency issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates in GitHub issue comments
- **Context Preservation**: Detailed session logs for seamless handoffs

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All implementations require review before merge
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests mandatory for each component
- **Performance Validation**: Components must meet defined targets
- **Documentation**: API documentation updated with each implementation

## Risk Mitigation & Monitoring

### High-Risk Areas (Extra Monitoring)
1. **Issue #7** (Migration System): Data integrity critical - assign senior agent
2. **Issue #10** (Activities Table): High-volume performance - requires optimization specialist
3. **Cross-dependencies**: Monitor handoffs between agents carefully

### Contingency Planning
- **Agent Failure Recovery**: Backup agents on standby for critical path items
- **Dependency Blocking**: Alternative implementation strategies prepared
- **Integration Issues**: QA agent deployment accelerated if needed

## Success Metrics & Tracking

### Daily Objectives
- **Day 1**: Issues #4 and #6 in progress with agent deployment successful
- **Day 2**: Issue #4 complete, #5 started, #6 in progress
- **Day 3**: Issues #5 and #6 complete, #7 started, QA agent deployed

### Milestone Progress Indicators
- **25% Complete**: TypeScript foundation and database connection operational
- **50% Complete**: Migration system and core tables implemented
- **75% Complete**: All schema and performance optimization complete
- **100% Complete**: Full MCP server core infrastructure operational

## Agent Deployment Commands

### Ready to Execute
```bash
# Primary critical path agents
nohup claude -p "You are Implementation Agent Alpha. Your task is to complete Issue #4 (Project Initialization & Configuration) in jetrich/tony-mcp. Follow the atomic task breakdown exactly as specified. Focus on TypeScript project setup, package.json configuration, ESLint/Prettier setup, and directory structure. Provide completion evidence and detailed handoff documentation for Issue #5 continuation." &

nohup claude -p "You are Database Agent Beta. Your task is to complete Issue #6 (SQLite Connection Layer) in jetrich/tony-mcp. Follow the atomic task breakdown for SQLite3 integration, connection management, error handling, and initialization logic. Ensure foundation is ready for Issue #7 (Migration System). Provide completion evidence and database connection validation." &
```

### Monitoring and Coordination
- Monitor both agents for progress and blockers
- Prepare for Issue #5 and #7 deployment upon completion
- Deploy QA agent on Day 3 for validation and testing

**Status**: Ready to begin agent coordination for MCP Server Core Infrastructure implementation.
