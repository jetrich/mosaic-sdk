- **Database Infrastructure**: #6, #7, #15 (SQLite connection, migrations, health checks)
- **Core Schema**: #8, #9, #10 (Projects, agents, activities tables)
- **Performance**: #12, #13 (Indexing, connection pooling)

### Issue #2: MCP Tool Interfaces Implementation  
**Decomposed into**: 8 atomic tasks  
**Estimated Duration**: 13 development days

- **Activity Logging**: #20, #21 (logActivity, queryActivity)
- **Tool Infrastructure**: #22, #23 (Registration framework, validation)

### Issue #3: Docker Containerization Implementation
**Decomposed into**: 7 atomic tasks  
**Estimated Duration**: 7 development days  
**Focus**: Multi-stage builds, CI/CD pipeline, security scanning  

#### Created Tasks (#24-30)
- **Dockerfile**: #24, #25 (Multi-stage design, health checks)
- **Docker Compose**: #26, #27 (Service config, volumes/networking)
- **CI/CD & Registry**: #28, #29 (GitHub Actions, ghcr.io publishing)
- **Security**: #30 (Vulnerability scanning, compliance)

## Cross-Issue Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **Issue #1 Foundation** → **Issues #2 & #3** (Database and server needed for tools and containerization)
2. **Database Schema** (#8, #9, #10) → **Tool Implementations** (#16-21)
3. **Health Checks** (#15) → **Docker Health Configuration** (#25)
4. **Tool Registration** (#22) → **All Tool Implementations** (#16-21)

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **TypeScript Foundation** (#4, #5) can run parallel to **Database Connection** (#6)
- **Tool Implementations** (#16-21) can develop in parallel after #22 completion
- **Docker Compose** (#26, #27) can develop parallel to **Dockerfile** (#24, #25)
- **Security Integration** (#30) can run alongside CI/CD development

## Critical Path Analysis

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
**Critical Path**: #4 → #5 → #6 → #7 → #22  
- Project initialization and build system
- Database connection and migrations
- Tool registration framework
- **Parallel Work**: #14 (Dev environment), #11 (Testing framework)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Days 4-10)
**Critical Path**: #8 → #9 → #10 → #16 → #18 → #20  
- Database schema implementation
- Core tool implementations (project → agent → activity)
- **Parallel Work**: #17, #19, #21 (Companion tools), #23 (Validation)

### Phase 3: Optimization & Containerization (Days 11-15)
**Critical Path**: #12 → #13 → #24 → #25 → #28 → #29  
- Database performance optimization
- Docker implementation and CI/CD
- **Parallel Work**: #26, #27 (Docker Compose), #30 (Security scanning)

## Risk Assessment Across All Issues

### High Risk Items (Require Extra Attention)
- **#7**: Migration System Implementation (data integrity critical)
- **#10**: Activities Table Implementation (high-volume performance)
- **#13**: Connection Pooling Implementation (concurrency complexity)
- **#20**: logActivity Tool Implementation (batch processing performance)
- **#28**: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline (multi-architecture builds)
- **#30**: Security Scanning & Vulnerability Management (compliance blocking)

### Medium Risk Items
- **#6**: SQLite Connection Layer (error handling complexity)
- **#12**: Database Indexing Strategy (performance tuning)
- **#21**: queryActivity Tool Implementation (query optimization)
- **#24**: Multi-stage Dockerfile Design (build optimization)

### Low Risk Items
- **#4, #5**: Project initialization and build system
- **#16, #17**: Project management tools (straightforward CRUD)
- **#26, #27**: Docker Compose configuration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance Targets
- **MCP Server**: Startup <2s, queries <10ms, 50+ concurrent connections
- **Tool Interfaces**: Response time <50ms, >90% test coverage
- **Docker Images**: Build <5min, size <100MB, startup <5s
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build time <10min, cache hit rate >60%

### Quality Gates
- All 27 issues completed with passing tests
- Database performance targets achieved
- Security scans show zero critical vulnerabilities
- Integration testing across all components successful
- Documentation complete and up-to-date

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Concurrent Development Streams
1. **Stream 1**: Database & Infrastructure (#4-7, #12-15)
2. **Stream 2**: Tool Implementation (#16-23)
3. **Stream 3**: Containerization & CI/CD (#24-30)

### Coordination Points
- **Day 3**: Database foundation complete → Enable tool development
- **Day 7**: Core tools operational → Enable container health checks
- **Day 10**: Performance optimization → Enable production deployment
- **Day 15**: Full system integration → Ready for beta release

## Total Project Timeline

### Conservative Estimate: 27 development days (single developer)
### Optimized with 3 parallel streams: 15 development days
### Critical path only: 12 development days minimum

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)
1. Begin Issue #4 (Project Initialization & Configuration)
2. Start Issue #6 (SQLite Connection Layer) in parallel
3. Set up development environment and GitHub repository structure

### Short Term (Days 2-5)

2. Implement migration system and tool registration framework
3. Begin core database schema implementation

### Medium Term (Days 6-12)
1. Develop all tool interfaces with proper validation
2. Implement performance optimization and monitoring
3. Begin Docker containerization implementation

### Final Phase (Days 13-15)
1. Complete CI/CD pipeline and security integration
2. Conduct comprehensive integration testing
3. Prepare for beta release and milestone 0.0.1 completion
