# Agent Deployment Blocking Issues Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-14 17:20  
**Analysis By**: Tech Lead Tony  

## Identified Blocking Issues

### 1. **Agent Process Lifecycle**
- **Issue**: Agents launched with `nohup claude` are terminating shortly after launch
- **Evidence**: 
  - Build System Agent (PID 3797997) no longer in process list
  - Migration System Agent (PID 3804172) no longer in process list
- **Root Cause**: Possible timeout or context initialization failure

### 2. **Context Inheritance**
- **Issue**: Agents not inheriting project directory context properly
- **Evidence**: 
  - Build System Agent output shows no awareness of project files
  - Migration Agent only produced documentation, couldn't create files
- **Root Cause**: Working directory not properly passed to agent sessions

### 3. **Permission Context Confusion**
- **Issue**: Agents reporting lack of permissions despite settings.json being configured
- **Evidence**: "I need file system permissions" messages from agents
- **Root Cause**: Agent sessions may not be loading user-level settings.json

### 4. **Command Execution Timeouts**
- **Issue**: Direct claude command tests timing out after 15 seconds
- **Evidence**: `claude -p "test"` command timeout
- **Possible Cause**: Interactive prompt or initialization delay

## Technical Analysis

### Environment Variables
- `CLAUDECODE=1` is set
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli` is set
- PATH includes `/home/localadmin/.npm-global/bin`

### File System Structure
- `.claude/settings.json` properly configured with permissions
- `.tony/hooks/` contains activity-logger.sh and agent-monitor.sh
- Log directories created but agents not writing to them

### Missing Components
1. **Working Directory Context**: Agents need explicit `cd` to project directory
2. **Settings Loading**: Agents may need explicit `--settings` flag
3. **Non-Interactive Mode**: Need to ensure non-interactive execution

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Explicit Context Injection
```bash
cd /home/localadmin/src/tony/framework-source/tony-mcp && \
claude -p "instructions" --model=sonnet --non-interactive
```

### Solution 2: Environment Variable Approach
```bash
export CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR=/path/to/project
export CLAUDE_SETTINGS=/home/localadmin/.claude/settings.json
claude -p "instructions"
```

### Solution 3: Wrapper Script Approach
Create a wrapper script that:
1. Sets up environment
2. Changes to correct directory
3. Launches claude with full context
4. Captures output properly

### Solution 4: Direct Implementation
Given the complexity of agent deployment issues:
- Proceed with direct implementation of critical components
- Investigate agent deployment separately
- Consider using Claude API directly for better control

## Additional Findings

### Command Whitelist Gaps
Found missing commands that were needed:
- `env` - Already present but patterns like `env | grep` might need explicit listing
- `find` - Added with common patterns
- Various npm run scripts specific to the project

### Hook Integration
The Tony hooks are properly installed but may not be triggering correctly for sub-agents:
- `/home/localadmin/.tony/hooks/activity-logger.sh`
- `/home/localadmin/.tony/hooks/agent-monitor.sh`

## Conclusion

The primary blocking issue is **context initialization** for sub-agents. The claude command is working but agents launched via nohup are not maintaining:
1. Working directory context
2. Settings file awareness
3. Process persistence

**Recommendation**: Proceed with direct implementation while investigating a more robust agent deployment mechanism.
