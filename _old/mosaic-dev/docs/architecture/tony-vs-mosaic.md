### 4. Integration Patterns

#### Tony in MosAIc

MosAIc uses Tony as its core execution engine:

```javascript
// MosAIc orchestrates multiple Tony instances
class MosAIcOrchestrator {
  async deployTonyAgent(project, task) {
    const tonyInstance = new TonyFramework({
      version: "2.5.0",
      project: project.repository,
      context: await this.buildContext(project)
    });
    
    return tonyInstance.execute(task);
  }
}
```

#### Standalone Tony

Tony operates independently for single projects:

```bash
# Direct Tony usage
$ cd my-project
$ claude
> Hey Tony, implement user authentication
# Tony handles everything within the project scope
```

### 5. Cost Considerations

#### Tony Framework
- **License**: Free (MIT)
- **Infrastructure**: Local machine only
- **AI Costs**: Pay per use (Claude API)
- **Maintenance**: Self-managed
- **Total Cost**: $0 + API usage

#### MosAIc Platform
- **License**: Free (MIT) / Enterprise options
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud hosting costs
- **AI Costs**: Optimized bulk pricing
- **Maintenance**: Managed options available
- **Total Cost**: $500-5000/month depending on scale

### 6. Migration Paths

#### Starting with Tony
1. Install Tony for immediate productivity
2. Use for individual projects
3. Learn UPP methodology
4. Build automation patterns

#### Upgrading to MosAIc
1. Keep Tony for local development
2. Deploy MosAIc for team coordination
3. Import existing Tony projects
4. Leverage enterprise features

```bash
# Import Tony project to MosAIc
mosaic import --from-tony ./my-project --team platform
```

### 7. Decision Framework

#### Choose Tony if:
- [ ] You're an individual developer
- [ ] Working on a single project
- [ ] Need minimal setup time
- [ ] Prefer CLI interfaces
- [ ] Have limited infrastructure
- [ ] Want to learn AI-assisted development

#### Choose MosAIc if:
- [ ] You're managing multiple projects
- [ ] Need team collaboration features
- [ ] Require audit trails and compliance
- [ ] Want visual project management
- [ ] Have distributed teams
- [ ] Need enterprise-grade reliability

### 8. Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use both:

1. **Development**: Developers use Tony locally
2. **Integration**: Code pushed to MosAIc for coordination
3. **Deployment**: MosAIc handles production workflows
4. **Maintenance**: Tony for quick fixes, MosAIc for releases

## Conclusion

Tony and MosAIc are not competitors but complementary tools:

- **Tony**: The power tool for individual developers
- **MosAIc**: The platform for enterprise coordination

Start with Tony to experience AI-powered development, then scale to MosAIc as your needs grow. Both tools share the same core philosophy: making software development more efficient through intelligent AI orchestration.
