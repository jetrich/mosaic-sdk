# GitHub Issues Repository Breakdown

## Repository Assignment for 12 New Innovations

### jetrich/tony Repository (7 Issues)

These innovations enhance the core Tony CLI framework:

#### High Priority
1. **ATHMS - Automated Task Hierarchy Management System**
   - Physical folder-based task tracking
   - Evidence-based validation
   - State persistence and recovery
   - **Rationale**: Core task management enhancement for CLI

2. **CI/CD Evidence Validator**
   - Multi-platform CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Azure DevOps)
   - Automated evidence collection
   - Build/test/quality/security validation
   - **Rationale**: Critical for quality assurance in CLI workflows

#### Medium Priority
3. **Advanced State Management** (Shared benefit)
   - Three-tier state system (global/project/agent)
   - Conflict resolution algorithms
   - State migration tools
   - **Rationale**: Benefits both single and multi-project scenarios

4. **Self-Healing Recovery System**
   - Pattern-based failure detection
   - Automated remediation plans
   - Recovery success metrics
   - **Rationale**: Extends Tony's existing emergency recovery

5. **Agent-ATHMS Integration Bridge**
   - Seamless agent-to-task integration
   - Real-time progress monitoring
   - Automatic task assignment
   - **Rationale**: Core agent coordination improvement

#### Lower Priority
6. **Unified Command Router**
   - Single entry point for all operations
   - Context-aware help system
   - Command aliasing and shortcuts
   - **Rationale**: Improves CLI user experience

7. **Plugin Hot-Reload System**
   - Live plugin updates without restart
   - File watching for changes
   - Dependency tracking
   - **Rationale**: Extends existing plugin architecture

### jetrich/mosaic-platform Repository (5 Issues)

These innovations are specifically for enterprise/multi-project features:

#### High Priority
1. **Enterprise Security Framework**
   - Access control management
   - Compliance reporting (SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001)
   - Security monitoring dashboard
   - Audit logging with analysis
   - **Rationale**: Essential for enterprise deployments

2. **Cross-Project Federation System**
   - Multi-project synchronization
   - Cross-project health monitoring
   - Resource pooling across projects
   - Global state synchronization
   - **Rationale**: Extends MosAIc's multi-project capabilities

#### Medium Priority
3. **Advanced State Management** (Shared benefit)
   - Enterprise-scale state management
   - Multi-tenant considerations
   - Cross-project state synchronization
   - **Rationale**: Critical for multi-project coordination

#### Lower Priority
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time system health metrics
   - Agent performance tracking
   - Alert management
   - Resource usage visualization
   - **Rationale**: Visual monitoring for enterprise deployments

5. **Docker Compose V2 Enforcement**
   - Automated v1 to v2 migration
   - Multi-project compatibility checking
   - Enterprise deployment validation
   - **Rationale**: Ensures consistent deployments across projects

### Special Considerations

#### Shared Features (Could go in either or both)
1. **Secrets Detection System**
   - **For Tony**: Pre-commit hooks for individual developers
   - **For MosAIc**: Enterprise-wide secret scanning
   - **Recommendation**: Create simplified version for Tony, full version for MosAIc

2. **Advanced State Management**
   - **For Tony**: Single-project state management
   - **For MosAIc**: Multi-project state federation
   - **Recommendation**: Create issue in both repos with different scopes
