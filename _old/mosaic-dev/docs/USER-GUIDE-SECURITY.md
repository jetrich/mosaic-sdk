## üéØ Security Best Practices

### Access Control Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Regular Access Reviews**: Review and revoke unnecessary access
3. **Strong Authentication**: Implement MFA for all privileged accounts
4. **Session Management**: Configure appropriate session timeouts

### Vulnerability Management Best Practices

1. **Regular Scanning**: Automated daily vulnerability scans
2. **Rapid Remediation**: Fix critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
3. **Patch Management**: Regular system and dependency updates
4. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize vulnerabilities by business impact

### Monitoring and Alerting Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all security-relevant events
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of critical systems
3. **Alert Tuning**: Minimize false positives through proper configuration
4. **Incident Response**: Maintain documented response procedures

### Compliance Best Practices

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular compliance assessments
2. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive security documentation
3. **Audit Trails**: Preserve detailed audit logs
4. **Regular Reviews**: Periodic compliance reviews and updates
