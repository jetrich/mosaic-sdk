# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
All documentation files have been properly organized into the `docs/` directory structure, removing clutter from the project root.

## Files Moved

### From Root → docs/architecture/
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture overview

### From Root → docs/getting-started/
- `GLOSSARY.md` - Project terminology definitions

### From Root → docs/project-management/
- `MIGRATION-PLAN.md` - Codebase restructuring plan
- `RESTRUCTURING-SUMMARY.md` - Restructuring status
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CRITICAL-DEPLOYMENT-CONTINUITY-FIX.md` - Deployment fixes

## Files Remaining in Root (Correctly)
- `README.md` - Main project readme (standard practice)
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions (must be in root for agents to find)

## New Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Master documentation index
├── architecture/               # Architecture and design docs
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── getting-started/            # New user documentation
│   └── GLOSSARY.md
├── project-management/         # Project management docs
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md
│   ├── MIGRATION-PLAN.md

```

## Benefits
1. **Clean Root Directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Organized Documentation** - Easy to find related docs
3. **Standard Practice** - Follows common open source conventions
4. **Better Navigation** - Master index helps discover all docs

## Updated References
- Main `README.md` now points to `docs/README.md` for documentation
- `docs/README.md` serves as master index with links to all documentation
- All internal links have been updated to use correct paths

The documentation is now properly organized and easily navigable!
