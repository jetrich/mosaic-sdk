# Tony-NG Restructuring Summary

## Work Completed

### Phase 1: Documentation and Planning ✅
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Created comprehensive architecture overview explaining:
   - What Claude is (AI powering the agents)
   - Tony Framework vs Tony-NG Application distinction
   - System architecture with diagrams
   - Current vs proposed directory structure

2. **GLOSSARY.md** - Created project glossary defining:
   - All project-specific terms
   - Agent types and roles
   - Technical concepts (UPP, Context System, etc.)

3. **MIGRATION-PLAN.md** - Created detailed migration plan with:
   - 10-phase implementation approach
   - Validation checklists
   - Rollback procedures
   - Communication plan

### Phase 2: Directory Restructuring ✅
1. **Created new directories**:
   - `framework/` - For Tony Framework components
   - `infrastructure/` - For deployment configurations
   - `examples/` - For example projects
   - `docs/` - Reorganized documentation structure

2. **Moved framework components**:
   - Core framework files → `framework/core/`
   - Context scripts → `framework/scripts/`
   - Context templates → `framework/templates/`
   - Created `framework/README.md`

3. **Renamed application directory**:
   - `tony-ng/` → `application/`
   - Updated application README to clarify purpose

## Current State

```
tony-ng/                          # Root directory (cleaner)
├── ARCHITECTURE.md               # New - explains entire system
├── GLOSSARY.md                  # New - defines all terms
├── MIGRATION-PLAN.md            # New - migration guide
├── framework/                   # New - Tony Framework
│   ├── README.md               # Framework documentation
│   ├── core/                   # Core framework files
│   ├── scripts/                # Context system scripts
│   └── templates/              # Context templates
├── application/                 # Renamed from tony-ng/
│   ├── README.md               # Updated to clarify
│   ├── frontend/               # React application
│   ├── backend/                # NestJS backend
│   └── infrastructure/         # App-specific infra
├── infrastructure/              # New - consolidated deployment
├── examples/                    # New - for test projects
└── docs/                       # Reorganized documentation
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Framework vs Application is now obvious
2. **No More Confusion**: Eliminated nested `tony-ng/tony-ng/` structure
3. **Better Organization**: Related components grouped together
4. **Improved Clarity**: New documentation explains everything

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
- [ ] Move test projects to `examples/` directory
- [ ] Create single root package.json with workspaces
- [ ] Update import paths and build scripts

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Consolidate remaining documentation
- [ ] Update Docker configurations for new paths
- [ ] Test full deployment pipeline

### Low Priority
- [ ] Update CI/CD configurations
- [ ] Create migration guide for developers
- [ ] Clean up old empty directories

## Key Improvements

1. **Developer Experience**:
   - New developers can understand structure immediately
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Logical grouping of components
   - Simplified paths (no more nested confusion)
   - Clear boundaries between systems

3. **Documentation**:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md explains the big picture
   - GLOSSARY.md defines all terms
   - Framework and Application have separate READMEs

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining consolidation tasks
2. Test that everything still builds and runs
3. Update team on new structure
4. Begin using new structure for development

The restructuring has successfully addressed the core confusion about the nested directory structure and created a clean, understandable architecture that separates the Tony Framework from the Tony-NG Application.
