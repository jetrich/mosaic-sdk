## 📋 Phase 1: Abstract Task Trees

### Objective
Create 1-10 high-level task trees that capture the project's major objectives without implementation details.

### Usage

```bash
# Start Phase 1
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan phase1

# Natural language: "Tony, create abstract task trees for this project"
```

### Process
1. **Objective Analysis**: Understand the project's core requirements
2. **Tree Creation**: Generate 1-10 major task trees
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify inter-tree dependencies
4. **Milestone Definition**: Define major project milestones

### Output Example
```markdown
# Task Tree 1: Frontend Development
- Objective: Create responsive user interface
- Dependencies: Backend API, Design System
- Milestone: Functional UI with all core features

# Task Tree 2: Backend API Development  
- Objective: Implement secure, scalable API
- Dependencies: Database Design, Authentication System
- Milestone: Fully tested API with documentation
```

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- ✅ All major project objectives captured
- ✅ No implementation details included
- ✅ Dependencies between trees identified
- ✅ Estimated effort for each tree provided

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Detailed Decomposition

### Objective
Break down each abstract task tree into detailed, atomic tasks with P.TTT.SS.AA.MM numbering.

### Task Numbering System
```
P.TTT.SS.AA.MM
├── P: Phase number (1-9)
├── TTT: Task number (000-999, resets per phase)
├── SS: Subtask number (00-99)
├── AA: Atomic task number (00-99)
└── MM: Micro task number (00-99)
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start Phase 2 decomposition
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan phase2

# Process specific tree
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan decompose tree-1.000

# Natural language: "Tony, decompose task tree 1 into atomic tasks"
```

### Sequential Processing Rules

#### Ultrathink Protocol Rules
1. **Single Tree Focus**: Complete one tree before starting the next
2. **No Premature Optimization**: Don't optimize until functionality is complete
3. **Implementation Agnostic**: Focus on what needs to be done, not how
4. **Atomic Tasks Only**: Each task must be completable in ≤30 minutes

#### Example Decomposition
```
Tree 1.000: Frontend Development
├── 1.001: Project Setup
│   ├── 1.001.01: Initialize React project
│   ├── 1.001.02: Configure build system
│   └── 1.001.03: Setup development environment
├── 1.002: Component Architecture
│   ├── 1.002.01: Design component hierarchy
│   ├── 1.002.02: Create base components
│   └── 1.002.03: Implement component library
└── 1.003: Feature Implementation
    ├── 1.003.01: User authentication flow
    ├── 1.003.02: Dashboard functionality
    └── 1.003.03: Data visualization components
```

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- ✅ All trees decomposed to atomic level
- ✅ Each task ≤30 minutes duration
- ✅ Clear success criteria for each task
- ✅ Dependencies explicitly defined

---

## 🔍 Phase 3: Gap Analysis & Integration

### Objective
Identify missed dependencies, integration points, and gaps between decomposed tasks.

### Usage

```bash
# Start Phase 3 analysis
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan phase3

# Generate gap analysis report
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan gaps

# Natural language: "Tony, perform gap analysis on the decomposed tasks"
```

### Gap Analysis Process

#### 1. Dependency Validation
```bash
# Check for missing dependencies
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan validate-dependencies

# Example gaps found:
# - Task 1.002.01 requires design system (not in any tree)
# - Task 2.001.03 depends on 1.003.01 (cross-tree dependency)
# - Integration testing not covered in any decomposition
```

#### 2. Integration Point Identification
```bash
# Find integration requirements
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan find-integrations

# Common integration points:
# - Frontend-Backend API integration
# - Database schema coordination
# - Authentication system integration
# - Third-party service integration
```

#### 3. Missing Task Discovery
```bash
# Identify missing tasks
./scripts/tony-tasks.sh plan find-missing

# Typically missed:
# - Error handling and validation
# - Testing and quality assurance
# - Documentation and deployment
# - Security implementation
# - Performance optimization
```

### Phase 3 Output Example
```markdown
# Gap Analysis Report

## Missing Dependencies
- Design System (required by Frontend Development)
- Authentication Service (required by Backend API)
- Database Schema (required by Data Layer)

## Integration Points
- Frontend ↔ Backend API (authentication, data flow)
- Backend ↔ Database (ORM configuration, migrations)
- CI/CD ↔ Testing (automated test execution)

## Missing Tasks Added
- 1.004: Design System Implementation
- 2.004: Authentication Service
- 3.001: Database Schema Design
- 4.001: Integration Testing
- 5.001: Deployment Pipeline
```

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- ✅ All dependencies validated and added
- ✅ Integration points explicitly defined
- ✅ Missing tasks identified and added
- ✅ Complete project roadmap available

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Planning Phase Best Practices

1. **Start with User Stories**: Base task trees on user value delivery
2. **Maintain Abstraction**: Don't include implementation details in Phase 1
3. **Focus on Outcomes**: Define what success looks like for each tree
4. **Consider Dependencies Early**: Map major dependencies between trees

### Decomposition Best Practices

1. **One Tree at a Time**: Complete full decomposition before moving to next tree
2. **Atomic Tasks Only**: Each task should be completable in one sitting
3. **Clear Success Criteria**: Every task needs unambiguous completion definition
4. **Evidence Planning**: Define what evidence will prove completion

### Integration Best Practices

1. **Thorough Gap Analysis**: Don't skip the second-pass analysis
2. **Integration Testing**: Always include integration verification tasks
3. **Documentation**: Document all integration points and dependencies
4. **Recovery Planning**: Include recovery procedures for critical paths
