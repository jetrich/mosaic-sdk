# Security Test Plan - Phase 1
## Tony-NG Security Audit Test-First Approach

### Test Strategy
Following TDD principles, all tests must be written BEFORE implementation:
1. Write failing tests (RED phase)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN phase)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (REFACTOR phase)

### Security Test Categories

#### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Tests
- Node.js 18â†’22 compatibility
- Package vulnerability scanning
- Deprecated package detection
- Security advisory checks

#### 2. Authentication Security Tests
- JWT implementation security
- Bcrypt hashing strength
- Password policy enforcement
- Session management security

#### 3. Transport Security Tests
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Helmet.js security headers
- CSP implementation

#### 4. Input Validation Tests
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal prevention

#### 5. Rate Limiting Tests
- API rate limiting
- Login attempt limiting
- DDoS protection
- Resource exhaustion prevention

### Test Evidence Requirements
Each test suite must document:
1. Initial test failure (RED phase evidence)
2. Implementation to pass test (GREEN phase evidence)
3. Final test success with coverage metrics
4. Security vulnerability remediation proof

### Critical Security Packages to Test
Based on package.json analysis:

**Backend Security Concerns:**
- bcrypt: v5.1.1 (latest, check for Node.js 22 compatibility)
- helmet: v7.1.0 (latest, verify configuration)
- @nestjs/jwt: v10.2.0 (check for security updates)
- passport-jwt: v4.0.1 (verify latest security patches)
- csurf: v1.2.2 (DEPRECATED - needs replacement)
- express-session: v1.17.3 (check for vulnerabilities)
- crypto: v1.0.1 (DEPRECATED - built into Node.js)

**Frontend Security Concerns:**
- No direct security packages, but check:
  - React 19.1.0 (very new, check for security advisories)
  - Socket.io-client for secure WebSocket connections
  - Apollo Client for GraphQL security

### Test Execution Order
1. Dependency vulnerability scan tests
2. Authentication mechanism tests
3. Transport security tests
4. Input validation tests
5. Rate limiting tests
6. Integration security tests

### Success Criteria
- 100% of security tests must pass
- 90%+ code coverage for security modules
- Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- All deprecated packages replaced
- Full Node.js 22 compatibility verified
