# BookStack Documentation Structure Enforcement Summary

## The Problem

Your observation was correct - the documentation is scattered and doesn't follow the BookStack shelf/book/chapter/page structure. This makes it difficult to:
- Find documentation
- Maintain consistency
- Sync to BookStack properly
- Prevent agents from creating docs "wherever"

## The Solution

I've implemented a comprehensive enforcement system:

### 1. Mandatory Documentation Rules (`.mosaic/DOCUMENTATION-RULES.md`)
- **CRITICAL** document that ALL agents must read
- Defines the 4-level hierarchy: Shelf → Book → Chapter → Page
- Shows correct file paths and naming conventions
- Provides examples of what NOT to do
- Added to CLAUDE.md as required reading

### 2. Helper Tools

#### List Valid Paths (`scripts/list-valid-doc-paths.py`)
```bash
# Show all valid documentation paths
python3 scripts/list-valid-doc-paths.py

# Show as tree structure
python3 scripts/list-valid-doc-paths.py --format tree

# Filter by category
python3 scripts/list-valid-doc-paths.py --category troubleshooting
```

#### Migration Tool (`scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py`)
```bash
# Analyze current issues (142 files need migration!)
python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --analyze

# Generate migration report
python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --report

# Perform migration (dry-run first)
python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --migrate --dry-run

# Create missing directories
python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --create-dirs
```

### 3. Pre-commit Hook (`.mosaic/hooks/pre-commit-docs`)
- Validates documentation structure before commit
- Checks 4-level hierarchy
- Ensures numbered filenames (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Validates required frontmatter
- Prevents bad documentation from entering the repository

### 4. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added documentation rules as IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- All agents must read DOCUMENTATION-RULES.md
- Clear warning about structure requirements

## Environment Variables

Yes, the Woodpecker secrets are:
- `BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_ID` - The API token ID from BookStack
- `BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_SECRET` - The API token secret

## The 405 Error

The error you saw is already fixed in the sync script. Modern BookStack versions automatically handle book-to-shelf relationships when creating books, so the `/attach` endpoint returns 405. The script now:
1. Tries to attach (for older versions)
2. Catches the 405 error
3. Continues normally (since it's auto-attached)

## Current State

- **78 documentation files** need to be migrated to proper structure
- **142 total issues** found (files not in hierarchy or not numbered)
- The sync will fail until docs follow the structure

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration** (recommended approach):
   ```bash
   # First, create missing directories
   python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --create-dirs
   
   # Review migration plan
   python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --report > migration-plan.md
   
   # Perform migration
   python3 scripts/migrate-doc-structure.py docs/ --migrate
   ```

2. **Install Pre-commit Hook**:
   ```bash
   cp .mosaic/hooks/pre-commit-docs .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

3. **Update All Agents**:
   - Ensure all agents read `.mosaic/DOCUMENTATION-RULES.md`
   - Train them to use `list-valid-doc-paths.py`
   - Enforce validation before commits

4. **Configure BookStack Tokens**:
   ```bash
   # In Woodpecker secrets or .env
   BOOKSTACK_URL=https://docs.mosaicstack.dev
   BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_ID=your-token-id
   BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_SECRET=your-token-secret
   ```

## Benefits

With this enforcement system:
- ✅ Agents can't create docs "wherever"
- ✅ All docs follow BookStack structure
- ✅ Sync to BookStack works properly
- ✅ Easy to find documentation
- ✅ Consistent organization
- ✅ Automated validation

The system is now in place to prevent the chaos you were concerned about!
