# MosAIc Stack Continuous Agent Orchestration Plan
## Objective: Achieve Functional MCP + Tony 2.8.0 with Gitea CI/CD in 24 Hours

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Critical Path
1. Complete all CI/CD pipeline configurations
2. Implement MCP integration for Tony 2.8.0
3. Document entire stack architecture
4. Clean and organize all repositories
5. Push to Gitea and validate CI/CD execution

### ðŸ“‹ Agent Deployment Sequence

## Phase 1: Documentation & Analysis (Hours 0-6)

### Agent 1: MCP Integration Specialist
```bash
claude -p "Analyze tony/mcp-unblock/ and implement the minimal MCP interface into Tony 2.8.0. Create the integration following the patterns in integration-example.ts. Update Tony's package.json and create necessary MCP coordination modules. Document all changes in docs/mcp-integration/."
```

### Agent 2: CI/CD Pipeline Engineer
```bash
claude -p "Create comprehensive .woodpecker.yml files for all repositories: tony, mosaic, mosaic-dev, and mosaic-sdk. Each should include: dependency installation, linting, testing, building, and Docker image creation where applicable. Also create Dockerfiles for repositories that don't have them. Use the mosaic-mcp/.woodpecker.yml as a template."
```

### Agent 3: Documentation Architect
```bash
claude -p "Create complete documentation structure in docs/ for the MosAIc stack. Include: architecture diagrams (using Mermaid), deployment guides, service documentation, API references, troubleshooting guides, and operational procedures. Focus on making it production-ready."
```

## Phase 2: Implementation & Cleanup (Hours 6-12)

### Agent 4: Repository Organizer
```bash
claude -p "Clean up all test files listed in deployment/CLEANUP-LIST.md. Organize the deployment directory structure. Add proper .gitignore files to all repositories including database files, logs, and build artifacts. Ensure all repositories have updated README files with clear setup instructions."
```

### Agent 5: Configuration Manager
```bash
claude -p "Create production-ready configuration templates for all services. Document environment variables, create docker-compose.production.yml with proper secrets management, implement backup scripts for PostgreSQL/MariaDB/Redis, and create monitoring configuration for the stack."
```

### Agent 6: Tony 2.8.0 MCP Implementation
```bash
claude -p "Complete the Tony 2.8.0 MCP integration by implementing the minimal MCP interface from mcp-unblock. Update Tony's agent coordination to use MCP, ensure backward compatibility, and create migration documentation. Test the implementation with the isolated MCP server on port 3456."
```

## Phase 3: Integration & Validation (Hours 12-18)

### Agent 7: Git Repository Manager
```bash
claude -p "Prepare all repositories for Gitea push. Create proper .gitattributes, update all .gitignore files, ensure consistent commit messages, and create repository documentation. Stage all changes properly without committing yet."
```

### Agent 8: Integration Validator
```bash
claude -p "Create integration tests for the MCP-Tony connection. Write test scripts that validate: MCP server connectivity, agent registration, request routing, and coordination workflows. Document the test procedures and expected outcomes."
```

### Agent 9: Stack Orchestration Designer
```bash
claude -p "Based on the mcp-orchestration-docs findings, create a detailed implementation plan for evolving mosaic-mcp into a full orchestrator. Design the plugin architecture, service abstraction layer, and migration path from minimal to full MCP."
```

## Phase 4: Final Preparation (Hours 18-24)

### Agent 10: Deployment Finalizer
```bash
claude -p "Create final deployment checklist, validate all configurations, ensure all services have health checks, create operational runbooks, and prepare the stack for production use. Generate a comprehensive status report of what's ready and what needs attention."
```

### Agent 11: CI/CD Validator
```bash
claude -p "Create test repositories with sample code to validate each CI/CD pipeline. Ensure pipelines handle: successful builds, failed tests, Docker image creation, and proper notifications. Document the CI/CD workflow for each repository type."
```

### Agent 12: Final Integration Agent
```bash
claude -p "Perform final integration validation: test Tony 2.8.0 with MCP, verify all services communicate properly, validate CI/CD readiness, and create a launch checklist for when you return. Document any blocking issues that need human intervention."
```

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Coordination Protocol

Each agent should:
1. Check previous agent outputs before starting
2. Update progress in their designated docs/ subdirectory
3. Create TODO items for any blockers
4. Hand off to the next agent with clear status

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
- [ ] All repositories have .woodpecker.yml files
- [ ] Tony 2.8.0 has functional MCP integration
- [ ] Complete documentation in docs/
- [ ] All test files removed
- [ ] Production configurations ready
- [ ] Repositories prepared for Gitea push
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines validated
- [ ] Comprehensive operational documentation

## ðŸš¨ Agent Coordination Rules
1. NEVER STOP - Always hand off to next agent
2. Document everything in the appropriate docs/ subdirectory
3. If blocked, document the issue and move to next task
4. Use atomic commits with clear messages
5. Test everything that can be tested locally

This plan ensures continuous progress toward a functional MosAIc stack with MCP integration and CI/CD ready for your return.
