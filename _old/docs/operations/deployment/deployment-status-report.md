## What Needs Attention

### ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Tasks

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Create production `.env` file with real values
   - [ ] Generate all secret keys and tokens
   - [ ] Configure SMTP settings for notifications
   - [ ] Set proper domain names

2. **SSL Certificates**
   - [ ] Configure Let's Encrypt email
   - [ ] Verify domain ownership
   - [ ] Test certificate renewal

3. **Backup Destination**
   - [ ] Configure remote backup storage
   - [ ] Test backup upload/download
   - [ ] Verify encryption keys

4. **Final Security Review**
   - [ ] Change all default passwords
   - [ ] Review firewall rules
   - [ ] Enable fail2ban
   - [ ] Configure rate limiting

### ⚠️ Known Issues and Workarounds

| Issue | Impact | Workaround | Fix ETA |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| MCP server startup delay | Low | Manual retry after 30s | v0.2.0 |
| Gitea webhook race condition | Low | Restart Woodpecker agent | Next release |
| Grafana dashboard import | Low | Manual import via UI | Fixed in PR |

## Performance Baselines

### Resource Requirements
- **CPU**: Minimum 8 cores recommended
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100GB minimum, 500GB recommended
- **Network**: 100Mbps minimum

### Expected Performance
| Service | Metric | Baseline | Target |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Gitea | Clone speed | 50MB/s | 100MB/s |
| Plane | API response | 200ms | <100ms |
| PostgreSQL | Queries/sec | 1000 | 2000 |
| Redis | Ops/sec | 10000 | 50000 |

## Security Considerations

### Security Posture
- **Network Security**: ✅ Configured
  - All services behind reverse proxy
  - Internal networks isolated
  - External ports minimized

- **Access Control**: ⚠️ Needs Review
  - Default admin accounts need password changes
  - 2FA should be enabled on all services
  - API keys need rotation schedule

- **Data Protection**: ✅ Ready
  - Encryption at rest configured
  - Backup encryption enabled
  - TLS for all external communication

- **Compliance**: ⚠️ Pending
  - GDPR compliance needs review
  - Log retention policies need setting
  - Data residency requirements unclear

   ./scripts/post-deployment-verify.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Backups**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add: 0 2 * * * /opt/mosaic/scripts/backup/backup-all.sh
   ```

3. **Enable Monitoring Alerts**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/enable-alerts.sh --email ops@example.com
   ```

4. **Security Hardening**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/security-hardening.sh --production
   ```

## Recommendations

### High Priority

3. **Configure automated backups** immediately
4. **Enable security monitoring** from day one

### Medium Priority
1. **Optimize database performance** after baseline
2. **Implement log rotation** policies
3. **Setup performance monitoring** dashboards
4. **Create user training materials**

### Future Enhancements
1. **Kubernetes migration** for better scaling
