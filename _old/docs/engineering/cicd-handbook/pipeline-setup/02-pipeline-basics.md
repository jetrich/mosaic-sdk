# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the CI/CD pipeline implementation for all MosAIc SDK repositories using Woodpecker CI version 3.8.0.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Tony Framework (`tony/`)
- **Pipeline**: Created `.woodpecker.yml` with comprehensive TypeScript testing
- **Dockerfile**: Created multi-stage build with Node.js 20 Alpine
- **Features**:
  - Type checking (strict mode)
  - ESLint and Prettier enforcement
  - Unit and coverage testing with Vitest
  - Planning engine testing (Python scripts)
  - Security auditing
  - Matrix builds for Node.js 18, 20, 22
  - Docker image creation
- **README**: Updated with CI/CD documentation

### 2. MosAIc Platform (`mosaic/`)
- **Pipeline**: Created `.woodpecker.yml` for frontend/backend testing
- **Dockerfile**: Existing Dockerfiles utilized (frontend, backend)
- **Features**:
  - Separate frontend (React) and backend (NestJS) pipelines
  - PostgreSQL and Redis services for integration tests
  - E2E testing with Playwright
  - Type checking for both frontend and backend
  - Security scanning
  - Multi-stage Docker builds
- **README**: Updated with CI/CD documentation

### 3. MosAIc MCP (`mosaic-mcp/`)
- **Pipeline**: Already existed, used as template for others
- **Dockerfile**: Already existed with multi-stage build
- **Features**:
  - TypeScript compilation
  - Database integration tests
  - Health check endpoint
  - Non-root user security
- **README**: Updated with CI/CD documentation

### 4. MosAIc Dev SDK (`mosaic-dev/`)
- **Pipeline**: Created `.woodpecker.yml` for SDK components
- **Dockerfile**: Created multi-stage build for development tools
- **Features**:
  - Multi-component testing (dev tools, testing framework, migration tools)
  - Type safety across all SDK components
  - Performance testing
  - Coverage reporting
  - Quality gates enforcement
  - Security scanning
- **README**: Updated with CI/CD documentation

### 5. MosAIc SDK Meta Repository (`mosaic-sdk/`)
- **Pipeline**: Created `.woodpecker.yml` for orchestrating all components
- **Dockerfile**: Created development environment container
- **Features**:
  - Submodule initialization and management
  - Parallel component testing
  - Isolated MCP environment testing
  - Docker compose validation
  - Release artifact creation
  - Cross-component integration testing
- **README**: Updated with comprehensive CI/CD documentation

## Pipeline Standards

All pipelines follow these standards:

### 1. Triggering Events
- Push to main, develop, feature/*, hotfix/* branches
- Pull requests

### 2. Common Steps
- Dependency installation with verification
- Type checking (for TypeScript projects)
- Linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier)
- Build validation
- Unit testing
- Integration testing (where applicable)
- Security auditing
- Docker image building (main branch only)

### 3. Service Dependencies
- PostgreSQL 17.5 Alpine (where needed)
- Redis 7 Alpine (where needed)

### 4. Docker Standards
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Node.js 20 Alpine base images
- Non-root user execution
- Health checks where applicable
- Proper signal handling with tini

### 5. Security Features
- npm audit on production dependencies
- Non-failing security scans (warnings only)
- Vulnerability tracking

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. All tests can be run locally using npm scripts
2. Docker images can be built locally for testing
3. Pipeline validation: `woodpecker lint .woodpecker.yml`

### For DevOps
1. Woodpecker 3.8.0 required
2. Docker registry credentials needed for image pushing
3. Set `dry_run: false` in Docker build steps when ready to push

## Next Steps

1. Configure Woodpecker server with these pipelines
2. Set up Docker registry for image storage
3. Configure secrets for deployment
4. Enable automated deployments
5. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Notes

- All pipelines are optimized for Woodpecker 3.8.0
- Docker images use `dry_run: true` by default (change to false for production)
- Matrix builds allow testing across multiple Node.js versions
- Services (PostgreSQL, Redis) are automatically provisioned for tests
