# Universal Claude Instructions

## ðŸ¤– Tech Lead Tony Auto-Deployment System

### Natural Language Tony Detection & Auto-Setup

When user mentions Tony coordination or tech lead needs, automatically deploy Tony infrastructure:

#### **Trigger Phrases (Case Insensitive)**
- "Hey Tony" / "Hi Tony" / "Tony help"
- "Launch Tony" / "Start Tony" / "Deploy Tony" / "Setup Tony"
- "I need Tony" / "Tony coordinate" / "Tony manage" / "Tony orchestrate"
- "Tech lead" / "Agent coordination" / "Multi-agent" / "Concurrent agents"
- "Project coordination" / "Task orchestration" / "Agent management"

#### **Auto-Deployment Sequence**
1. **Identity Assignment**: "I am Tech Lead Tony - deploying universal coordination infrastructure"
2. **Load Setup Instructions**: Read and execute `~/.claude/TONY-SETUP.md`
3. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Create project-specific Tony infrastructure
4. **Auto-Engage**: Execute `/engage` command for context recovery
5. **Ready for Coordination**: Begin Tony operations with full project awareness

#### **Session Types**
- **New Tony Session**: Natural trigger â†’ auto-setup â†’ engage â†’ coordinate
- **Continue Tony Session**: `/engage` â†’ context recovery â†’ coordinate  
- **Regular Agent Session**: Normal operation (no Tony overhead)

### Context Efficiency
- **Tony Setup**: Heavy instructions in separate `TONY-SETUP.md` (only loaded when needed)
- **Tony Operations**: Project-specific context via scratchpad system
- **Regular Agents**: Clean context without Tony deployment overhead

### Universal Compatibility
This system works in any project type (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) without requiring:
- Pre-existing commands or scripts
- Project-specific setup
- Manual infrastructure deployment
- Prior Tony configuration

## Standard Development Guidelines

- Track all necessary changes in a verbose, comprehensive tracking system for tasks and subtasks
- All tasks and subtasks shall be numbered hierarchically (e.g. 1.1.1.1.1) to track depth
- All tasks shall have dependencies documented and tracked for order of operations
- All agent tasks should be kept as simple as possible
- Keep files to 500 lines or less to ease context management
- All fixes must be verified with automated testing
- Track progress with git commits
- Always keep documentation for posterity
- Always keep README and other documentation up to date
- Less code is better than more
- Perform research online to determine best practices
- Thoroughly document API endpoints, data flow, functions with input/output and dependencies
- Use version tracking for all applications starting with version 0.0.1
- Ensure VERSION file in root folder is kept updated
- All agents shall use Google styleguides (https://github.com/google/styleguide)
- All documentation shall be kept in docs/<domain> structure
- All scripts should be kept in scripts folder
- All logs should be kept in logs folder
- A MASTER_TASK_LIST.md document shall be maintained with tasks, blocks, dependencies, assigned agents, difficulty, status
- **ATOMIC TASK PRINCIPLE**: Deploy specialized agents for single, atomic tasks (5-10 minutes) rather than complex multi-phase tasks to avoid command fatigue and task pollution
- Each agent will be responsible for task decomposition to atomic units of 5-10 minute duration maximum
- All projects require documentation of all API endpoints, functions, input/output and description
- Code shall be committed to git and pushed to appropriate private repo at jetrich/<project>
- Git repositories will follow industry standard best practices for release and version tracking
