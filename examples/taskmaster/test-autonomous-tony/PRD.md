# Product Requirements Document: TaskMaster Web Application

## 1. Overview

TaskMaster is a simple, web-based task management application that allows users to create, organize, and track their daily tasks. The application provides a clean interface for basic CRUD operations on tasks with user authentication and persistent storage.

### 1.1 Product Vision
A lightweight, responsive task management tool that helps users organize their work efficiently without complexity overhead.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Individual professionals managing personal tasks
- Small teams needing basic task coordination
- Developers testing autonomous agent systems

### 1.3 Core Features
- User registration and authentication
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Task status management (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Task filtering and sorting
- RESTful API for external integrations

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Authentication
- As a new user, I want to register an account so I can access the application
- As a returning user, I want to log in to access my tasks
- As a user, I want to log out securely when I'm done

### 2.2 Task Management
- As a user, I want to create a new task with title, description, and due date
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a organized list
- As a user, I want to edit task details to keep information current
- As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed when finished
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed)
- As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date or creation date

### 2.3 Data Persistence
- As a user, I want my tasks saved automatically so I don't lose work
- As a user, I want my tasks available when I return to the application

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js single-page application
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity (easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **API**: RESTful JSON API

### 3.2 Technology Stack
- Node.js (v16+)
- Express.js
- React.js (v18+)
- SQLite3 with better-sqlite3 driver
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- cors for cross-origin requests

### 3.3 Data Models

#### User Model
```
User {
  id: INTEGER (Primary Key)
  email: STRING (Unique, Required)
  password: STRING (Hashed, Required)
  name: STRING (Required)
  created_at: DATETIME
  updated_at: DATETIME
}
```

#### Task Model
```
Task {
  id: INTEGER (Primary Key)
  user_id: INTEGER (Foreign Key to User)
  title: STRING (Required, Max 200 chars)
  description: TEXT (Optional)
  status: ENUM ['pending', 'in-progress', 'completed']
  due_date: DATE (Optional)
  created_at: DATETIME
  updated_at: DATETIME
}
```

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1 Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

### 4.2 Task Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks for authenticated user
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get specific task
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task

### 4.3 API Request/Response Examples

#### Create Task
```
POST /api/tasks
Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
Body: {
  "title": "Complete project documentation",
  "description": "Write comprehensive docs for the new feature",
  "due_date": "2024-01-15",
  "status": "pending"
}

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "task": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Complete project documentation",
    "description": "Write comprehensive docs for the new feature",
    "status": "pending",
    "due_date": "2024-01-15",
    "created_at": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 5. Frontend Requirements

### 5.1 Pages/Components
- **Login Page**: Email/password form with registration link
- **Registration Page**: User signup form
- **Dashboard**: Main task list with filtering and sorting
- **Task Form**: Modal or page for creating/editing tasks
- **Navigation**: Header with logout and user info

### 5.2 UI/UX Requirements
